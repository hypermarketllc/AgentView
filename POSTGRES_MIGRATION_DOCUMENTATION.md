# PostgreSQL Migration Documentation Overview

This document provides an overview of the documentation created for the PostgreSQL migration project.

## Documentation Files

We have created several documentation files to cover different aspects of the PostgreSQL migration:

1. **POSTGRES_MIGRATION_FIXES.md** - Overview of the issues encountered and fixes implemented
2. **MIME_TYPE_FIX_TECHNICAL.md** - Technical details of the MIME type fixes
3. **POSTGRES_QUICKSTART.md** - Quick start guide for running the application with PostgreSQL
4. **POSTGRES_DOCKER_GUIDE.md** - Guide for deploying the application with PostgreSQL using Docker

## Documentation Purpose

Each document serves a specific purpose:

| Document | Purpose | Target Audience |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| POSTGRES_MIGRATION_FIXES.md | Provides an overview of the issues encountered during migration and the solutions implemented | Project managers, developers |
| MIME_TYPE_FIX_TECHNICAL.md | Explains the technical details of the MIME type fixes for maintenance and future development | Developers, technical leads |
| POSTGRES_QUICKSTART.md | Offers simple instructions for running the application with PostgreSQL | End users, system administrators |
| POSTGRES_DOCKER_GUIDE.md | Provides Docker-specific deployment instructions | DevOps engineers, system administrators |

## Key Issues Addressed

The documentation covers the following key issues:

1. **MIME Type Errors**: JavaScript modules failing to load due to incorrect MIME types
2. **Path-to-RegExp Warnings**: Warnings related to route pattern handling
3. **Database Migration**: Steps to migrate from Supabase to PostgreSQL
4. **Docker Deployment**: Options for deploying with Docker

## Solutions Implemented

The solutions implemented include:

1. **Multi-layered MIME Type Fix**:
   - Server-side header setting
   - Client-side fetch patching
   - HTML response modification

2. **Path-to-RegExp Patch**:
   - Applied patch to handle invalid route patterns

3. **Run Scripts**:
   - Created convenient scripts for running the application with all fixes

4. **Docker Configurations**:
   - Development setup
   - Production setup
   - All-in-One setup
