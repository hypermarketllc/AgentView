# Login Issues Fix Documentation

## Problem Overview

The login functionality was not working properly due to a mismatch between the authentication system and the database structure. The main issues were:

1. The authentication system was looking for password hashes in the `users` table, but they should be stored in a separate `auth_users` table.
2. The `auth_users` table was missing or not properly populated.
3. The login endpoints were not correctly querying the database tables.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive fix that addresses all aspects of the login system:

### 1. Database Structure Fix

- Created a separate `auth_users` table to store authentication information (user IDs, emails, and password hashes).
- Ensured proper relationships between the `users` table (which stores user details) and the `auth_users` table (which stores authentication credentials).

### 2. Authentication Endpoints Fix

- Updated the login endpoints (`/api/auth/login` and `/crm/api/auth/login`) to query the `auth_users` table for password verification.
- Updated the registration endpoint to create entries in both the `users` and `auth_users` tables.
- Fixed the user retrieval endpoint to properly join the `users` and `auth_users` tables.

### 3. Data Migration

- Created a script (`sync-auth-users.js`) that ensures all existing users in the `users` table have corresponding entries in the `auth_users` table.
- Added a default password for users without a password, which they can change later.

### 4. System Health Monitoring

- Added a login health check to the system health monitoring to ensure the login functionality is working properly.
- The health check tests both the login endpoint and the user retrieval endpoint.

## Files Modified

1. `server-docker-auth.js` - Updated authentication middleware and auth routes
2. `fix-auth-endpoints.js` - Script to fix authentication endpoints
3. `fix-auth-login.js` - Script to fix admin login
4. `sync-auth-users.js` - Script to ensure auth_users table exists and is populated
5. `test-login-health.js` - Script to test login functionality and add health check
6. `fix-login-issues.js` - Script to run all fixes in the correct order

## How to Apply the Fix

Run the following command to apply all fixes:

```bash
node fix-login-issues.js
```

This script will:

1. Ensure the `auth_users` table exists and contains entries for all users
2. Fix the admin login
3. Test the login functionality and add a health check

After running the fix, you can start the server with:

```bash
node run-fixed-auth-server.js
```

## Testing the Fix

You can test the login functionality with the following credentials:

### Admin User
- Email: admin@americancoveragecenter.com
- Password: Discord101!

### Test Agent
- Email: agent@example.com
- Password: Agent123!

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter login issues after applying the fix, check the following:

1. Ensure the database connection is working properly
2. Verify that the `auth_users` table exists and contains entries
3. Check the server logs for any error messages
4. Run the `test-login-health.js` script to test the login functionality

## Security Considerations

1. The fix includes a default password for users without a password. It's recommended to prompt users to change their password on first login.
2. The JWT secret is set to a default value if not provided in the environment variables. For production, it's recommended to set a strong, unique JWT secret.
3. Password hashing is done using bcrypt with a salt rounds value of 10, which provides a good balance between security and performance.
