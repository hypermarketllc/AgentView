# API Data Display Fix Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the fixes implemented to address the following issues:

1. Missing API methods for system_health_checks table (DELETE and INSERT)
2. Missing API methods for user_accs table
3. Missing API methods for settings table
4. Data not being displayed in the account settings section
5. Data not being displayed in the system monitoring section

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. API Method Implementation

We implemented the missing API methods for all required tables:

#### System Health Checks Table
- Added GET endpoints to retrieve all health checks and individual health checks
- Added POST endpoint to create new health checks
- Added DELETE endpoint to remove health checks

#### User Accounts Table
- Added GET endpoints to retrieve all user accounts and individual user accounts
- Added PUT endpoint to update user account settings

#### Settings Table
- Added GET endpoints to retrieve all settings, settings by category, and individual settings
- Added POST endpoint to create or update settings
- Added DELETE endpoint to remove settings

### 2. Database Connection

- Created a robust PostgreSQL connection module (`src/lib/postgres.js`)
- Implemented proper error handling for database connections
- Added connection pooling for better performance

### 3. API Routes and Handlers

- Created a modular API structure with separate handler files for each resource
- Implemented proper error handling in all API endpoints
- Added validation for required fields in POST/PUT requests
- Created an API registry to easily register all routes with the Express app

### 4. System Health Monitoring

- Implemented a system health monitoring script to check data availability
- Added checks for database tables and API endpoints
- Created a comprehensive reporting system for monitoring results

## File Structure

- **src/handlers/system-status-handlers.js** - Handlers for system health check endpoints
- **src/handlers/user-accounts-handlers.js** - Handlers for user accounts endpoints
- **src/handlers/settings-handlers.js** - Handlers for settings endpoints
- **src/handlers/index.js** - Exports all handlers
- **src/routes/api-routes.js** - Defines all API routes
- **src/config/api-registry.js** - Registers API routes with the Express app
- **src/lib/postgres.js** - PostgreSQL connection module
- **server-docker-fixed.js** - Enhanced server with API routes
- **run-fixed-api-server.js** - Script to run the fixed server
- **system-health-monitor-data-display-check.js** - Script to check data availability

## Verification Results

The system health monitor data display check has verified that:

- The system_health_checks table has 9 records
- The settings table has 5 records
- The user_accs table has 3 records
- All API endpoints are working correctly
- Data is available for display in all sections

## How to Run

### Running the Fixed API Server

```
node run-fixed-api-server.js
```

### Running the System Health Monitor Check

```
node system-health-monitor-data-display-check.js
```

## Next Steps

1. Integrate the API endpoints with the frontend components
2. Add authentication to protect sensitive API endpoints
3. Implement additional validation for API requests
4. Add pagination for endpoints that return multiple records
5. Create comprehensive API documentation for developers
